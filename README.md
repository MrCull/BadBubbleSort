# BadBubbleSort
A poorly written Bubble Sort to be used during candidate interviews

After letting the candidate look at the algorithm for a short while then ask…
-	What does it do
-	Complete the output
-	Code Review - if a colleague wanted to commit this code what issues/feedback would you pass to them:
  -	Comments
  o	Class/Variable name
  o	Duplicated code; why is this bad
  o	Move sort into function
  o	Create interface “iSorting” - implement static class “BubbleSort”
- Inefficiencies - can the candidate spot any of these
  o The algorithm does not check and exit early once array is in a sorted sequence
  o The algorithm does not reduce the bounds of the inner for loop after each iteration
-	Do you know the name of the algorithm - Bubble sort
  o	Can you name any other sorting algorithms.
    ~ Which ones are more efficient?
  o	Average Time Complexity in “big O” notation. Θ(n^2)
  o	Average Space Complexity in “big O” notation. Θ(n)
