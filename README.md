# BadBubbleSort
A poorly written Bubble Sort to be used during candidate interviews

After letting the candidate look at the algorithm for a short while then ask…
-	What does it do

-	Complete the output

-	<b>Code Review - if a colleague wanted to commit this code what issues/feedback would you pass to them:<b>
  -	Comments
  -	Class/Variable name
  -	Duplicated code; why is this bad
  -	Move sort into function
  -	Create interface “iSorting” - implement static class “BubbleSort”
  
- Inefficiencies - can the candidate spot any of these
  - The algorithm does not check and exit early once array is in a sorted sequence
  - The algorithm does not reduce the bounds of the inner for loop after each iteration
-	Do you know the name of the algorithm - Bubble sort
  -	Can you name any other sorting algorithms.
    ~ Which ones are more efficient?
  -	Average Time Complexity in “big O” notation. Θ(n^2)
  -	Average Space Complexity in “big O” notation. Θ(n)
